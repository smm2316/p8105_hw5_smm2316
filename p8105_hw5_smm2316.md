### Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

``` r
clean_iris = function(x) {
  
   if (is.numeric(x)) {
   replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
   }
   else if (is.character(x)) 
     {replace_na(x, "virginica")}
}

output = map_dfr(.x = iris_with_missing, ~ clean_iris(.x))
output %>%
  view()
```

### Problem 2

``` r
names_df =
  tibble(
  subject = list.files(path="./data")
)
file_path = "./data/"
file_names = file_path %>%
  list.files()
observations_df =
  file_names %>%
  map_dfr(function(file_name){
 
  read_csv(paste0(file_path, file_name))
})
```
